# Decision-Making-Statement-Loops
Aim-To study and implement C++ decision making statement loops

Theory-In programming, decision-making statements and loops are fundamental constructs that enable developers to control the flow of execution within a program. They allow for the creation of dynamic and responsive software that can adapt to varying conditions and perform repeated tasks efficiently. Loops, such as for, while, and do-while, allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a specified condition is met. The for loop is ideal for iterating a known number of times, often used when working with arrays or collections. The while loop checks the condition before each iteration and is useful when the number of iterations is not predetermined. The do-while loop ensures the code block is executed at least once, as the condition is evaluated after the loop's body
